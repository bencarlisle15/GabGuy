GabGuy v1.0
Created by Ben Carlisle

GabGuy is a chatbot that's easy to talk to. Whether it be for fun, to learn something or even just to talk, GabGuy, for all your gabbing needs.

Features:
1.) Ask GabGuy a question and he will scavange the Internet in search of an answer for you (type ping to test your connection). Ex. "What's Google"
2.) Ask GabGuy a math question and he will solve it (no current support for algebraic equations). Ex. "1-2+3/4*5^6"
3.) Ask GabGuy to play a game with you and your wish is his command (support for Blackjack, Rock Paper Scissors, Elevens, and Thirteens). Ex. "Let's play a game"
4.) Tell GabGuy your name and he'll always remember it. Ex. "My name is GabGuy"
5.) Tell GabGuy to learn to say something and he'll say it back to you. Ex. "If I say this then say that"
6.) Ask GabGuy for the time or date and he'll use his internal atomic clock to find it exactly. Ex. "What is the date"
7.) Or just talk with GabGuy like anyone else!  Ex. "Why are you called GabGuy"

Happy gabbing!
