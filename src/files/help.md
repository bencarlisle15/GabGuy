GabGuy v1.0
Created by Ben Carlisle and Andrew Wolstenholme

GabGuy is a chatbot that's easy to talk to. Whether it be for fun, to learn something or even just to talk, GabGuy, for all your gabbing needs.

Features:
1.) Ask GabGuy a question and he will scavange the Internet in search of an answer for you (type ping to test your connection). Ex. "What's Google"
2.) Ask GabGuy a math question and he will solve it (no current support for algebraic equations). Ex. "1-2+3/4*5^6"
3.) Ask GabGuy to play a game with you and your wish is his command (support for Tic Tac Toe, Brick Breaker, Blackjack, Rock Paper Scissors, Elevens, and Thirteens). Ex. "Let's play a game"
4.) Tell GabGuy your name and he'll always remember it. Ex. "My name is GabGuy"
5.) Tell GabGuy to learn to say something and he'll say it back to you. Ex. "If I say this then say that"
6.) Tell GabGuy to keep a list of something and he'll keep track of it. Ex. "Add eggs to my shopping list"
7.) Ask GabGuy for the time or date and he'll use his internal atomic clock to find it exactly. Ex. "What is the date"
8.) Or just talk with GabGuy like anyone else!  Ex. "Why are you called GabGuy"

Specific help:
1.) If GabGuy takes too long to respond any operations can be canceled by typing.
2.) To play Tic Tac Toe, click in one of the empty squares to place your move. The goal is to get three in a row.
3.) To play Brick Breaker, move the paddle left and right to stop the ball from hitting the ground. Remove all bricks to win (side hits change angles).
4.) To play Blackjack, type hit to add a card, fold, to stop adding cards, or double down (if you only have two cards) to add one card and double your stake. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (Ace counts as 1 or 11, King, Queen, and Jack count as 10).
5.) To play Rock Paper Scissors, type either rock, paper, or scissors to play your move.
6.) To play Elevens, select two cards that add up to 11 or a triplet of a Jack, Queen, and King to remove them. The goal is to remove all of the cards.
7.) To play Thirteens, select two cards that add up to 13 or a King to remove them/it (Jack counts as 11, Queen counts as 12). The goal is to remove all of the cards.

Happy gabbing!
